        ## What NetMention Is

NetMention is an application whose purpose is to bring the functionality of webmention to the .NET world; it consists of two components; a graphical user interface, where users can input text for replies, likes, favorites, and so on of other people's posts on the internet (particularly in the realm of the IndieWeb), and a command line interface (CLI) where folks can do the same, except that instead of having a graphical interface, all actions are typed out manually. Good for scripting and incorporating into other workflows.

## Rationale

This tool came about based on my desire to bring the .NET world into the Indieweb fold, considering much of the Indieweb technologies are based on three languages: PHP, Python, and Node. All of those, too, have their place in the web development world, however, with .NET's new cross-platform-ness, I found it necessary to actually create a project showcasing the wide array of applications for the modern .NET ecosystem, particularly those which haven't been tackled yet. This is my attempt at such a project; all contributions, suggestions,      
    feedback, criticism, and code contributions are welcome; for I would love to see more .NET folks getting involved in these fairly new standards, too.
