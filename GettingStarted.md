      # NetMention
Wwebmention sender/receiver written in PowerShell and C#.

this application is an attempt at creating a .net-based representation of the webmention W3C standard. eventually it will support both sending and receiving; reception will be provided by a .NET Core service. sending will be through PowerShell cmdlets and/or via a graphical user interface on top of the main script. Watch this space to stay updated.
